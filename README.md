How to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program, as applicable:

In our Guess Who game, there are two players. Each player is assigned one random celebrity out of a list of 20 pre-selected celebrities that they have to guess. When it is a playerâ€™s turn, they have the opportunity to either ask about a trait of their chosen celebrity, or make a final guess on who the celebrity is. Each time a player asks a trait question, their list of celebrities is printed out to show how it changed, and which celebrities they are left to choose from. A player wins if they can correctly guess who their randomly assigned celebrity is before the other player.
